# google-homepage

This project is a part of The Odin Project's curriculum. 
It's a part of the Foundations path which is the first part of the 
curriculum. 

The project at hand is to create the google homepage using HTML and CSS.
It's just supposed to look like the google.com page not actually work like it.
